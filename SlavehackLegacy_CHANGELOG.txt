All changes below are for the pre-game site only.
============================================

*- 9/14/2014 ------------------------------------------*
+ Added a simple hover effect to the menu, links and footer.
- Removed some needless/redundant CSS formatting codes throughout.
+ Added a "page_parts.php" file that enables us to change one file versus each page individually. The "page_parts.php" file currently includes the menu, footer and individual page contents in separate functions. Pages with forms have not beed added yet, but will be added after thorough testing. Eventually one-file-maintenance can be achieved.
- Removed the difficult background image.
+ Added an easy to manage background that has maintains site relevance.
+ Forced the footer information to the bottom of the screen. Now follows scroll motion.
+ Added a bottom margin to the wrapper to compensate for the footer's area. The bad look only appeared on "long" pages such as "register.php".
: Changed margins in the wrapper to fix "bunching" on form pages. Should not affect normal content pages.
+ Added Pure CSS stylesheet to "register.php" to improve the look of form components. All form pages will have some version of this for flow.

*- 9/15/2014 ------------------------------------------*
- Removed the old navigation menu.
+ Added a new menu. Fixed navigation to highlight current page.
: Changed the logo to a graphic. Up for debate and can be changed easily.
+ Added CSS Validated icon to the footer. Yes, our CSS is awesome!
? Add paypal donation icon to the footer?
+ Added ticking to the clock and date.
: Changed the layout of the register form to look a little more sleek.
? Recommending that the hiatus post be removed from "README.md" to attract help.
+ Added a small amount of formatting to "logout.php".
+ Added "local_content_SCREENSHOT.png" in "img" to show the difference between local and hosted site.

*- Future Plans ---------------------------------------*
TODO: Clean up the stylesheet "main.css" for easier reading and alteration.
TODO: Remove static clock code.
TODO: Download only the needed components of Pure CSS to be altered for our color scheme. This requires us to add a comment that the stylesheet is from Pure and edited by us.
TODO: Get database to properly test login, logout, and activation pages.
